# A Benchmark for Deep Learning Based Object Detection in Maritime Environments

The aim of this README is to give you alle necessary information to use the provided data and thus enable you to reproduce our results. 

To use this repository please refer to the [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) repository of Facebook AI Research to download and install the used framework.


## TODOs
- write a manual on how to use the provided data
- upload algorithm for automated generation of instance segmentation labels in maritime environments.
- upload config files necessary to reproduce training strategies
- upload evaluation scripts to make sure evaluation is done the same way
- upload files changed inside detectron such as dataset_catalog.py and task_evaluation.py
